### Underdeveloped wannabe fan of reddit and 4chan
Free forum application made by total rookie just learning to work with these things.
To be fair, I must warn you - this app uses minimal JavaScript (just Bootstrap), wchich is one of my professors requirements about this 
project. What I aim for is a hybrid between 4chan and reddit - any user can create any number of subforums, posts or comments but every post older than 7* days gets deleted by cron script.

Now, You are free to use it, modify it or whatever. The only requirement is for You to give me credit, that's all I want.

To do:
- [X] Fix "Modified" tag at post.html
- [ ] Move aPanel to different html
- [X] Simplify routes
- [ ] Add pagination
- [X] Add possibility for "sticky", non-deletable (for script) posts
- [ ] Add basic mail functionality for users
- [ ] Add basic notepad functionality for users
- [ ] Add favorite posts functionality for users
- [ ] Add basic mentioning functionality for users
- [ ] \(Optional)Add possibility to post images

*Right now I admit I care more about not using space than actually building community. This is still, after all, WIP, and to add to it right now I use free hosting.
Btw, they earned it: https://pythonanywhere.com
